This is derived from the example project referred to in the
Struts 2 documentation, Ready, Set, Go tutorial.
See:  http://struts.apache.org.

This is augmented with a simple Vaadin app.

Run command:
 mvn jetty:run

Then point your browser to
 http://localhost:8080/index


You should see a page that either says it's "failing" (no worries, it's
based on a random generator that gives you this message 50% of the time)
or it's "successful" in which case you should see a simple Vaadin application
running on the same page.
